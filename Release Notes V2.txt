This version uses a patched rename of keystone in the tools, so you can now build base games with original keystone directly from the tools without the need for a loader or gui.

The downside, you need to always make sure your app/base files has a keystone on "sce_sys\keystone" before using these to build a pkg as it will not build a pkg with a working keystone otherwise, which would cause the game to not work or save!

Pkgs will be created with a file named "fakekeys" which is the renamed generated fake keystone.

Use the gengp4's accordingly to make sure apps/bases are built with a keystone and avoid accidentally building patches/updates with keystones.

Enjoy :)
